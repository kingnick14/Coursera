We find ourselves with a crotchety ‘ancient’ dwarf, Flint Fireforge, who thinks that even a boulder warmed by the sun more comfortable than walking any more. We get it—he’s travelled far but he’s come back home, and he’s glad for it. The sky is a flawless azure, the trees are perfect, the lake is crystal and Flint is met by Tanis Half-Elven, an old friend and comrade. They both admit that neither found what they went off in search off five years ago—for Flint, it was the dwarf clerics, all of whom seem to have vanished in the Cataclysm (much like the Elves) and, for Tanis, it was peace of mind and the ancient true gods. While baring their souls to each other they are surprised by Tasslehoff, their trickster Kender friend who doesn’t have time to admit that he had no deep quests, as they are set upon by a bunch of hobgoblins who insist that they are ’patrolling’ the woods. Old friends have met and here comes the rude interruption.
